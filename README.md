The Odin Project Foundation Course CSS Final Assignment. It took me a good few days to complete this task. I spent a lot of time researching Flexbox and scratching my head at how it works but I've definately gained a lot of knowledge with it now including CSS skills in general.

Although I change the colour theme around and a lot of the sizing of things are most likely not the same, I gave it my best shot. Now to move onto JavaScript.
